# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:


### Step 1:

To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

### Step 2:

To get the input of distance two 2 points

### Step 3: 

Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula] d=√((x_2-x_1)²+(y_2-y_1)²)

### Step 4: 

To get the output

### Step 5:

The program was end

### PROGRAM:
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: E.Nandhini
#RegisterNumber:212222100030
import math
I1=[4,2]
I2=[10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((I2[0]-I1[0])**2+((I2[1]-I1[1])**2)))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```


### OUTPUT:

![distance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121998147/227248434-e049f2ce-7060-401b-a24d-b69023ba7358.png)

### RESULT:
The distance of two 2 points program is executed.
